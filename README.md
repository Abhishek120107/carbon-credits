# Carbon Credits — Mini Hackathon

## 1) What is a carbon credit? (simple)
A **carbon credit** is a tradable certificate that represents **one metric tonne of CO₂ equivalent (1 tCO₂e)** that has been reduced, avoided, or permanently removed from the atmosphere. Projects that create credits (for example, a forest protection project or a methane capture system) are verified by recognised standards and then issued credits which can be sold. When a credit is used to compensate for emissions it is **retired** so it cannot be sold again.
## 2) Why carbon credits are used (short)
- **Channel finance:** They direct private money to projects (renewables, reforestation, methane capture) that cut or remove greenhouse gases.
- **Corporate emissions strategy:** Companies use credits to compensate for emissions they cannot yet eliminate while reducing their operational emissions first.  
- **Support sustainable development:** Some standards require projects to deliver social or environmental co-benefits (jobs, health, biodiversity).

## 3) Important quality concepts (very short)
- **Additionality:** A project must produce reductions that **would not have happened without the carbon-credit revenue**. This is central to a credit’s credibility. 
- **Permanence & leakage:** For removals (like trees), permanence asks whether carbon will stay stored; leakage asks whether emissions were simply displaced elsewhere.  
- **Verification, registries & blockchain:**  
  Standards (e.g., Verra, Gold Standard) and registries record the creation and retirement of carbon credits so each credit is traceable and cannot be double-counted.  
  However, many traditional registries are centralised and not easily interoperable.  
  **By using blockchain technology — such as the Stellar network — the issuance, transfer, and retirement of carbon credits can be stored on a transparent, tamper-resistant ledger.**  
  This ensures that data cannot be secretly changed, all transactions are publicly verifiable, and credits can be represented as digital tokens that move quickly and securely between participants.


## 4) Caveats & the market today (short)
The voluntary carbon market has real value but also real problems: some credits have been found to fail modern integrity tests, and reforms are underway to improve quality and trust. Always prefer credits with clear verification, recent monitoring data, and co-benefits.
